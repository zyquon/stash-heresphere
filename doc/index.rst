Stash-VRoom!
============

Stash-VRoom is a Stash plugin that lets you browse your Stash VR content from HereSphere.

The `Design <design.html>`_ document briefly explains the broad philosophy and goals of Stash-VRoom.

The `User Guide <design.html>`_ explains how to view your Stash-organized VR content using HereSphere.

The `Developer Cookbook <cookbook.html>`_ shows how to use `stash_vroom` to build your own HereSphere
service using Stash content, but with custom logic and different behavior.
