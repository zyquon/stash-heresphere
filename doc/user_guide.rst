How to run VRoom so you can view your VR Stash from HereSphere
---------------------------------------------------------------

Stash-VRoom is not yet implemented as a Stash plugin.

I do not see any plugins that run long-term web services. The theory might be though:

* The plugin exists
* It has a task to start the web service.
* It has a simple config, or maybe just a few tasks to choose from, e.g. read-only mode
* The Stash UI needs a link to the HereSphere service to get the user started. Browse to Stash in HS, then click that link.

TODO explain all the current logic out of the box: play/pause, favorite, double click, etc.

Explain "views"
Explain tags vs. markers
